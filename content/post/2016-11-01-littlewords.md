### 1
喜欢在健身房跑步

面对镜子中完全坦诚的自己

渺小而真实

把胡思乱想通通过一遍

上楼，泡一杯咖啡

平静的看一会闲书

日复一日

更为谦和的对待人事

更为用力的追逐梦想

### 2
许多力所能及的善事

都和朋友有关

### 3
风险对价无处不在

### 4
For many times i have been talking to someone inside 

u have no idea what i have been through

u may never experience my despair

or my struggle 

### 5
I still value and appreciate these moments

when emotions exceed reasons

when intangible beautiful things strike the heart

when speaking out the promise that i thought to be stupid

we met

we separated 

you left your trace in my world

eventually became part of me
